# sql-challenge

In this project, I use SQL to analyze an employee data set from a ficticious company with data from employees who were employed during the 1980s and 1990s. The poject involved analyzing CSV files to create a relational datadase schema, import the data and then complete various analysis tasks on the data. The diagram below offers an ERD that visualizes the datadase structure, while the SQL files contain the build of the tables and queries.

Although not represented in the ERD, due to foreign key constraints in the software, the dept_mgr and dept_emp tables both rely on composite keys, comprised of the employee and department numbers. This image was generated using https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/
